# HyperionDev Program - T51 - Compulsary Task 1

## US Arrests 

In this task, I have performed clustering techniques on the dataset provided (UsArrests.csv) and analysed which method is the best. Secondly, I have performed PCA on the dataset to investigate if it helps the clustering of the observations.
